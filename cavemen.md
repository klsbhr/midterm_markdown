I am being one hundred percent serious

Life is a prison I don't feel like a person everything is pointless and meaningless and hopeless

I really feel like no matter how I look at it there's only the inevitability of suffering and death

Quite frankly I'm okay with the idea of hit rock on berry sleep don't think

We gotta quit thinkin God is gonna take care of everything the problems in this world began the second we became self aware

Self awareness is the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil, original divine sin, self importance

I propose the solution is eat berry in cave thank you have great day thank you for coming yes yes come again come again
