I am being **one hundred percent serious**

Life is a **prison** I don't feel like a person everything is pointless and meaningless and hopeless

In between my flesh and nerves and these artificial walls I eat mono sodium glutamake covered snacks...

Quite frankly I'm okay with the idea of hit rock on berry sleep don't think

We gotta quit thinking for ourselves *God is going to take care of everything* the problems in this world began the second we became self aware

Self awareness is the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil, original divine sin, self importance

I propose the solution is eat berry in cave thank you have _**great day**_ thank you for coming yes yes come again come again
