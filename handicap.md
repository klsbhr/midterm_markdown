# Get yoself ready for this!!!!

I lug AKs stay outta my lane

Stay out the handi parking spot I'll drop you like a lame

I don't care if you're old

I don't care if you can walk

When you see that I park kind of bold

Shut your ignorant mouth or end up lined with chalk!

              

That was my rap about parking in the handicapped parking spot thank you
